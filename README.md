# Docker Monitoring Logging and Alerting (DMLA) Framework 

```
Prerequisites:
- git installed

```
 
# How to use

To make this as simple as possible most of the commands are automated which leaves the user to run only a few command. 

Firstly 
``
git clone xxxx && cd xxxx
``
On a Windows system, execute dmla/setup/dmla_config.bat
Then run up the environment with the command. This will install DMLA 

```
vagrant up
```
Once the DMLA framework is built, we will ssh into it, either by vagrant ssh or vagrant putty. (Plugin is installed during dmla_config.bat)
```
vagrant putty
```



```



# Clean Up

Exit back to your host machines terminal and issue `vagrant destroy`
